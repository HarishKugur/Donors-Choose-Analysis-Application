      DonorsChoose.org is a program started in 2000 with the intent to help a classroom in need with resources. Public
      school teachers nearly from all over America create a classroom project requests stating the resources they need for
      teaching, and donors can choose any school and a project to give either part of the amount or the entire amount to
      the project through DonorsChoose.org. Teachers request for books as part of reading for the students, or technology
      to aid student’s learning through the portal (DonorsChoose.org), corresponding to the request a project is created
      with the required budget for the request along with the teacher’s note to the school requested. As donations fill
      the required budget for the project, all the resources are bought and given to the schools along with an intimation
      to the donors.
      Our project is aimed to work on the dataset given by DonorsChoose.org to draw analysis and give collective
      information on the data over time spread through various entities involved. Our website plans to give cumulative
      information about the data for teachers, users, donors and for the admin of DonorsChoose.org helping each one to
      understand how are the trends and where can they add more efforts to simplify the process and maximize the donations
      as early as possible. Adding this level of analysis and projections about the process can also provide a positive
      influence for users willing to donate by upholding the transparency of the system enabling more donations for
      projects.
